# CLAUDE.md Split Structure

The root `CLAUDE.md` was split into a global file and local sub-directory files so that:
- No single file exceeds 150 lines
- The root file holds only what is **always** needed
- Local files are loaded only when that phase is active

---

## Final File Structure

| File | Lines | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (root) | **65** | Role, condensed agent roster, rules, checklist, initialization |
| `src/CLAUDE.md` | **95** | EDA, Data Engineering, Optimization, FastAPI agents + Steps 3–10 |
| `tests/CLAUDE.md` | **8** | Testing Agent spec |
| `docs/CLAUDE.md` | **13** | Documentation Agent spec |
| `deploy/CLAUDE.md` | **120** | Docker, Git & Deploy, Cloud agents + Steps 11–12 |
| `deploy/cloud-render.md` | **58** | Step 13 — Render deployment |
| `deploy/cloud-platforms.md` | **148** | Step 14 — AWS, GCP, Azure, Fly.io, Railway |
| `deploy/cloud.md` | **6** | Index — `@`-imports cloud-render.md + cloud-platforms.md |

All files are ≤ 150 lines. ✅ No content was dropped — only reorganised.

## How It Works

- The root `CLAUDE.md` is **always loaded** (65 lines — very lean)
- Local files are only read when Claude navigates to that subdirectory or a sub-agent is triggered for that phase
- The `@`-import pointers in the roster table (`@src/CLAUDE.md`, `@deploy/CLAUDE.md`, etc.) tell Claude exactly where to look when a specific step is needed
- Token usage stays low because full step instructions only enter context when that agent/phase is actually active

## Agent → File Mapping

| Agent | Triggered By | Local File |
|---|---|---|
| 🔬 EDA Agent | Step 2 — EDA | `src/CLAUDE.md` |
| ⚙️ Data Engineering Agent | Step 3 — Preprocessing | `src/CLAUDE.md` |
| 🏆 Optimization Agent | Steps 4–6 — Training | `src/CLAUDE.md` |
| 🌐 FastAPI Agent | API development | `src/CLAUDE.md` |
| 🐳 Docker Agent | Step 12 — Docker | `deploy/CLAUDE.md` |
| 📄 Documentation Agent | Steps 8, docs | `docs/CLAUDE.md` |
| 🧪 Testing Agent | After pipeline | `tests/CLAUDE.md` |
| 🚀 Git & Deploy Agent | Steps 11–13 | `deploy/CLAUDE.md` |
| ☁️ Cloud Deploy Agent | Step 14 — Cloud | `deploy/CLAUDE.md` → `deploy/cloud.md` |
